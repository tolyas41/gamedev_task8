Use the matrix class developed earlier, as well as classes for reading/writing and sorting matrix-type objects.

Declare an iterator interface (abstract class) with functions:

Get the first item - first()

Go to the next item – next()

Implement a container class that has the following functionality:

- Allows you to add elements based on the specified loader

- Allows you to sort entered items

- Implements an indexer (operator [])

- Implements an iterator

- Allows you to delete items by number (don’t forget to delete an item itself)

- Print items list

Implement correct program operation when errors occur.
